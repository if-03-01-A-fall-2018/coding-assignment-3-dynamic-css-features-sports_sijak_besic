              <p>
                These types of sports are special and not many do these sports. But they still can be challenging, sometimes even more than usual sports.
                For example:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Extreme Ironing (shown in the picture)</li>
                  <li>Toe wrestling</li>
                  <li>Underwater hockey</li>
                  <li>Cycleball</li>
                  <li>E-Sports and so on..</li>
                </ol>

                <div>
                  They can be done in simple places, but sometimes even in extreme places like in the air or underwater.
                </div>

        <h2>Extreme sports</h2>
            <img width="300" height="200" src="pictures/image2.gif" alt="Mountain Climbing">
            <p>
              These sports also are done by many people, because they are very hard to execute. These are also very risky, you could die very easily.
              For example:
            </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Cliff climbing (shown in the picture)</li>
                <li>Mountain hiking</li>
                <li>Mountainbiking</li>
                <li>Skydiving and so on...</li>
              </ol>

              <div >
                They are done in odd and dangerous places and can only be performed by experts which are experienced.
              </div>
