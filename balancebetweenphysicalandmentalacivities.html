        you are less likely to face the adverse effects of everyday stress.

      <p>
        Sleep is body’s mechanism to recuperate and revive itself after everyday tasks.

        For the mind to stay focused on the job, both physical and mental health need to be aligned together.
        While most people think focus and concentration is a mental function, it actually requires a confluence of both mental and physical health.
